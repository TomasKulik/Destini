Learning Flutter and dart at appbrewery.co

Destini is a choose your own adventure game like Bandersnatch.

During this project I was thought:

* Modularising code into separate classes.
* Dart classes and objects.
* Using class constructors.
* Extracting Widgets to refactor code.
* Private and public modifiers in Dart.
* How to use Dart lists.
* The difference between var, const and final.
